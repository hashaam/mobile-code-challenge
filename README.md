# mobile-code-challenge

Implemented the code challenge by using the following:
 - Setup my own core data stack
 - Used core data for persistence
 - Used reachability swift cocoapods for reachability
 - Used protocol-oriented programming approach for downloading and parsing data (see Fetchable, JSONParsable, ImageParsable)
 - Used extensions as helpers to show custom views, for example showing Alert View when not reachable, and loading images from core data
